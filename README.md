# Patika Bootcamp Week 5 Assignment: Coroutine

# Introduction

Coroutines are a powerful feature in Kotlin and Android for asynchronous programming. They allow for the suspension of execution while waiting for external events, making it possible to write concurrent and efficient code.

## Some Examples
1. Basic Coroutine Usage: This example showcases the basics of using coroutines in Kotlin. It defines a simple coroutine function and demonstrates how to run it using runBlocking.
2. Coroutine Usage with IO Operations: This example demonstrates how to use coroutines with I/O operations. It illustrates how to manage multiple network requests concurrently and efficiently.

# Important

1. Sometimes there can be version issues with IntelliJ IDEA when using Coroutines, so be mindful of that.
2. Some codes sometimes cannot work due to Intellij IDEA version if you run whole code Android, it will execute.
